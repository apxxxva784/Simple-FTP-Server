# Simple-FTP-Server

The File Transfer server completes a simple objective.
We login to the server and create an open socket. The server then waits for any client to connect.
The client logs in and connects to the server host and port. 
Client sends confirmation for the file to be sent.
Server sends a .png to the clientâ€™s local directory.
Client confirms receipt of the file
The connection is then closed on both Server and client side. 
The server can handle multiple clients during one session.
